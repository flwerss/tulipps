        <h2> 
Why is it called Formula 1?</h2>
    <p>As for why Formula 1 is called Formula 1, this can be broken up into two parts.<br>
First up, the ‘Formula’ is a set of rules – covering car design, engine size,<br> component usage and much, much more – that all competitors must abide by. Secondly, the ‘One’ or ‘1’ simply denotes that it is the premier formula.</p>
    <h2>How does the F1 weekend work?</h2>
    <p>Formula 1’s standard weekend format takes place across three days:<br> Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
Friday features two 60-minute practice sessions for teams to set up<br> their cars and carry out a variety of runs on different fuel loads and tyre compounds, with a third practice hour following on Saturday for last-minute tweaks <br>and learnings.After final practice, drivers head into a three-stage qualifying session, with the slowest five drivers eliminated in an 18-minute Q1 phase, and five more<br> in a 15-minute Q2 segment, which sets positions 20-11 on the grid prior to any penalties. A final 12-minute long Q3 settles the top 10 grid slots, along with the coveted pole position.<br>Sunday brings the race itself, where drivers battle it out to score points and grab a spot on the podium.</p>
    <h2>How long do F1 races last?</h2>
    <p>Formula 1 races generally last between an hour-and-a-half and two hours, though this can be impacted by Safety Car<br> periodsthat slow the field down or red flags that halt the action – see the 2023 Australian Grand Prix as a prime example.Each race on the calendar<br> has a set number of laps based on the length of their respective circuit. The distance of each race is almost always equal to the fewest number of laps that exceed 305 kilometres.<br> Monaco is an exception to the rule, where the race length is equal to the fewest number of laps that exceed a distance of 260km, given its street circuit nature and lower speeds.</p>

    <h2>What’s the difference between F1 and the FIA?</h2>
    <p>Formula 1 works closely with governing body the FIA to put on a show each year: hence the official name<br> of ‘FIA Formula One World Championship’.F1, more specifically Formula One Management (FOM), who are<br> owned by United States-based media company Liberty Media, hold the sport’s commercial rights.The FIA, founded<br> in 1904, are the governing body for a host of motorsport competitions around the world, including F1. They oversee the<br> technical, sporting and financial regulations, ensuring that competitors are sticking to the rules, and set stringent safety standards.</p>
    <h2>How do F1 cars work?</h2>
    <p>Thousands of parts are involved in creating some of the fastest<br> and most advanced racing cars on the planet, spanning detailed bodywork,<br> suspension elements, turbo-hybrid power units, eight-speed paddle shift gearboxes,<br> 18-inch tyres and much more.When the engine powers it into life, an F1 car essentially<br> acts as an aeroplane flipped upside down, with front and rear wings – and everything in<br> between – pushing the car onto the track and giving it incredible levels of grip through corners.<br>That said, F1’s current technical regulations are based around a ‘ground effect’ aerodynamic concept,<br> with several carefully designed tunnels under the floor sucking the car to the track surface to generate even<br> more downforce.This, combined with simpler bodywork than previous years, means less ‘dirty air’ – or disrupted<br> airflow – is created and allows cars to follow each other more closely, opening up additional overtaking opportunities and adding to the on-track spectacle.</p>

    <h2>How many drivers and teams race in F1?</h2>
    <p>A total of 20 drivers and 10 teams make up the current F1 grid, with each outfit fielding two cars.<br>This ranges from teams who have been in F1 since the early decades, such as Ferrari and McLaren,<br> or relative newcomers like Haas, who entered the sport ahead of the 2016 season.In terms of the drivers,<br> experience ranges from world champions Lewis Hamilton, Fernando Alonso and Max Verstappen to rookie racers Oscar Piastri, Nyck de Vries and Logan Sargeant.</p>

    <h2>Who are the most successful F1 teams of all time?</h2>
    <p>While an F1 drivers’ world championship was in place from the inaugural 1950 season,<br> a constructors’ equivalent did not arrive until 1958, when Vanwall triumphed over Ferrari.<br>
Since then, Ferrari have established themselves as the most successful team in terms of championship<br> wins, collecting 16 constructors’ titles over the decades. Williams are next on the list with nine crowns, followed<br> by McLaren and Mercedes on eight.As for drivers’ titles, Ferrari lead the way on 15, with McLaren their nearest challengers<br> on 12, ahead of Mercedes (nine), Williams (seven) and Lotus and Red Bull (six).
Ferrari have also racked up the most race victories,<br> claiming 242 to date, followed by McLaren (183), Mercedes (125) and Williams (114), with Red Bull another team nearing a century of wins.</p>
    <h2>Who are the most successful F1 drivers of all time?</h2>
    <p>From F1’s all-time list of world champions, Hamilton shares the overall record of seven titles<br> with Michael Schumacher. Hamilton claimed his first title with McLaren in 2008, before adding six more<br> at Mercedes between 2014 and 2020, while Schumacher won the 1994 and 1995 crowns with Benetton, adding<br> another five (in a row) at Ferrari from 2000 to 2004.As it stands, Hamilton also holds the record for the most race<br> victories, logging 103 to date, along with the most pole positions, also bagging 103 up to now.Fellow multiple champions<br> include Fangio, who racked up five titles in the 1950s, Alain Prost, who won four across the 1980s and 1990s, and the recently<br> retired Sebastian Vettel, who collected a quartet of championships on the bounce from 2010 to 2013.
Ayrton Senna was a driver who<br> looked poised to reach those numbers in his legendary F1 career, but a tragic accident at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix left him with a<br> tally of three, alongside several other famous names.Max Verstappen is F1’s latest champion, winning the 2021 and 2022 titles with Red Bull, as he looks to make it three out of three in 2023.</p>
    <h2>Where does F1 race?</h2>
    <p>As mentioned, Formula 1’s inaugural season featured seven rounds,<br> spread out from May to September and predominantly staged in Europe<br> (the exception being the Indianapolis 500 in the United States, which most F1 drivers sat out).<br>New European events arrived as F1 developed, with the following decades bringing adventures to<br> South America, North America, Africa, Asia, Australia and, most recently, the Middle East – well and truly putting the ‘world’ in world championship.</p>
